<h1>What is this?</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-8">

    <p class="lead">This application allows you to create and spend
    from an Ethereum 2/3-multisig smart contract using your hardware
    wallet.</p>

    <p>It was built by <a href="https://www.unchained-capital.com"
    target="_blank">Unchained Capital</a> to help holders worldwide
    safely store their ETH using multisig cold-storage.  If you are
    storing ETH on a Trezor and you trust at least two other people,
    you could be doing it better.  Now you can use this application
    with your trusted friends, family, and colleagues to protect your
    wealth.</p>

    <p>To learn more about the design philosophy of this application
    and smart contract, read

    want to check out
    the <a href="https://github.com/unchained-capital/ethereum-mulitisig"
    target="_blank">source code</a> for the smart contract (which
    includes this dApp) on GitHub.  Unchained Capital is also
    operating a <a href="https://www.unchained-capital.com/bounties"
    target="_blank">bug bounty</a> around this contract & dApp.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p class="lead">This application connects <a href="https://trezor.io"
target="_blank">Trezor</a> hardware wallets with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p>When creating the multisig smart contract, 3 Trezors are required.
When spending, 2/3 of these same Trezors are required.  The private
keys used to create and spend from a contract are only present on your
Trezors.  This application stores no data whatsoever about you, your
Trezors, your addresses, or your transactions.</p>

<p>This means that you are completely in control of your own security
and accounting.  In particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must yourself track the addresses of the smart contracts
  this application creates.</li>
  <li>For each such address, you must track which Trezors you used to
  create the address, along with which BIP32 derivation path you used
  on each Trezor (it is OK to reuse the same 3 Trezors & BIP32
  paths).</li>
  <li>You must protect these Trezors and their corresponding wallet
  words.  2/3-multisig is a great security improvement over singlesig
  but that's no excuse to get sloppy about the security of an
  individual key.</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Connecting to the Ethereum network</h2>

<p class="lead">This application requires a funded account in a
synced, connected Ethereum client to pay for gas.</p>

<p>The Ethereum transactions required to create and spend from the
smart contract will be authored by this application.  Broadcasting
them to the Ethereum network requires a synced, connected Ethereum
client.  The client should have an account with some modest ETH
balance to pay for gas.  As of this writing, 0.01 ETH is more than
sufficient.</p>

<p>The account used to pay for gas has absolutely no special rights to
fund, spend from, or otherwise control the smart contract this
application creates.  Only the private keys on the 3 Trezor devices
you used to create the smart contract matter.  Creating and spending
from a smart contract can be done by totally separate accounts, as
long as this application and the same 3 Trezors are used.</p>

<p>Because of this design, a browser-based wallet such
as <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank">Metamask</a>
provides acceptable security and is also extremely convenient.</p>

<p>Full Ethereum nodes such as <a href="https://www.parity.io/"
target="_blank">Parity</a> or <a href="https://geth.ethereum.org/"
target="_blank">Geth</a> will also work, though may require some
special configuration or browser extensions.</p>
